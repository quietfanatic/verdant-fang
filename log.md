- Some cancelled work making the ayu description system support llvm
- Started work on character art.  One standing frame, two attack frames, and
  almost two running frames.  Character ended up better looking than expected.
- Customized render pipeline a bit.  `GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE` and alpha blending.
- Started experimenting with sound effects.  Tentative landing SFX.
